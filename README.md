Cargo Shipping System companion implementation.

## What it is
Page-by-Page implementation of the Cargo Shipping System of Chris Evan's Domain Driven Design-book.
This is a work of progress.


### Notes
 - Chris Evan uses the name **"Activity Logging Application"** [DDD, Evans, p.172] when referring to the **"Incident Logging Application"**. I'm  using the same name for the class representing this application in `src/Application/ActivityLoggingApplication.php`
